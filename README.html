Simulation of hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent
activity in prefrontal cortex

Reference: Winograd M, Destexhe A, Sanchez-Vives, MV.
Hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity in 
the prefrontal cortex.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
105: 7298-7303, 2008.

Intrinsic currents: INa, IKd for action potentials, IM for
spike-frequency adaptation, ICaL for calcium currents, 
calcium dynamics and the hyperpolarization-activated current
Ih.  There is also a calcium regulation of Ih, which was 
taken from thalamic neurons (Destexhe et al., J Neurophysiol.,
1996)

demo_HPGA_non-saturating.hoc:
"non-saturating" model (Fig 4 of the paper)

demo_HPGA_non-saturating_noIh.hoc: 
"non-saturating" model, no Ih (Fig 4 of the paper)

"saturating" model (supplementary Fig S7 of the paper)

Usage:

Autolaunch from ModelDB and select to run an above file from the radio
buttons and press Init & Run to generate graphs for example like (the
first Fig 4 non-saturating):

or download and extract the archive, then under

linux/unix:
-----------

cd to the extracted folder and compile the mod files with nrnivmodl.
Then type "nrngui mosinit.hoc" to start the simulations.

mswin:
------

Compile the mod files with mknrndll (cd to the extracted folder and
make the dll).  Double click on mosinit.hoc file to start the
simulations.

MAC OS X:
---------

Drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc file on the nrngui icon to start the simulations.

The model files were supplied by Alain Destexhe.
